The To-Do List Application is a command-line program written in Python that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. Users can add, view, mark, and delete tasks, while all data is stored in a JSON file for persistence.

Features

- Add Task: Input the title, description, and category of a task.
- View Tasks: Display a list of all tasks with their status (completed or not).
- Mark Task Completed: Easily mark tasks as completed.
- Delete Task: Remove tasks from the list.
- Data Persistence: All tasks are stored in a `tasks.json` file, ensuring data is retained between sessions.
